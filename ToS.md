## 1.1 Description
SearchDeck is a search engine that scrapes many websites to show you results all at once so that you never have to switch search engines again.

## 1.2 Third Party Services
To fit everyone's needs, we allow people to signup or login with an account to save preferences. The login system is fully managed by SJAUTH, and is used by many services. Your password is hashed, salted, and secured inside of a database, and is never sold or shared with anyone. Your account will never be used for any sort of marketing purposes, and will remain confidential.

# 2. Age Limits
By registering for an account on SJAUTH, you agree to be at least the age of 13 years. By following this age limit, you comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. By using SearchDeck, you acknowledge the fact that you may see content unsafe for minors. The Developers are working to integrate SafeSearch, but there is no censor as of now.
